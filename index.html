    <!-- OpenGL 3D Graphics Application -->
    <h4>Original Version</h4>
    <div class="project-gallery">
        <img src="Images/SoftDesignInitial.png" alt="Original OpenGL Project - Screenshot 1" width="400">
        <div class="description-box">
            <p>This project is a 3D graphics application built using OpenGL. It demonstrates advanced rendering techniques like shadow mapping, shaders, lighting effects, and texture application. The goal was to create a real-time 3D scene with efficient memory management and optimized rendering performance, showcasing different textures and lighting models.</p>

    <h4>Enhanced Version</h4>
    <div class="project-gallery">
        <img src="Images/SoftDesignFinal.png" alt="Enhanced OpenGL Project - Screenshot 1" width="400">
        <div class="description-box">
            <p> I started with a simple OpenGL design featuring 3D shapes like cones and boxes. Over time, I enhanced the project to include more realistic objects, textures, and lighting, as shown in the second image. The progression from basic geometric shapes to lifelike elements demonstrates my growth in working with rendering techniques and shader programming. I chose this artifact because it showcases my ability to move from simple designs to more complex, realistic scenes—skills that are highly relevant to fields like game development and simulation.</p>

        <img src="Images/DataStructInit.png" alt="Original Weight Tracking App - Screenshot 1" width="300">
        <div class="description-box">
            <p>The Weight Tracker System is a mobile app that helps users track their weight, set goals, and view progress with stats like average weight. Initially, it provided basic features like weight entry, unit selection, and a simple log. It has since been enhanced with goal setting, progress charts, and visual statistics.</p>

        <div class="description-box">
            <p>This artifact was selected for the ePortfolio because it demonstrates key mobile app development skills, including data handling, algorithmic logic, and the use of data structures. The app utilizes a database to perform CRUD operations, applies algorithms to calculate weight statistics, and uses lists to manage data efficiently. Enhancements include goal-setting functionality, data persistence with SharedPreferences, UI improvements for better usability, and a graph feature for visual weight tracking to provide users with a clear view of their progress over time.</p>

        <img src="Images/DataBaseInitial.png" alt="Original Weight Tracking App - Database Screenshot 1" width="300">
        <div class="description-box">
            <p>The Weight Tracker System is a mobile app that allows users to track their weight, set goals, and view stats like average weight and progress. Initially, it provided basic features like weight entry, unit selection (Kg/Lbs), and a simple log. The app, which only uses a local SQLite database, has since been enhanced with goal setting, weight charting, and visual progress statistics.</p>

        <div class="description-box">
            <p>The Weight Tracker System was selected for my ePortfolio because it demonstrates key skills in mobile app development, database integration, and user interface design. The app uses both a local SQLite database for offline storage and Firebase Firestore for cloud data persistence. Key features include user authentication, real-time chart updates, and saving goal weights. I enhanced the app by adding fields and buttons for seamless updates between the app and Firebase, improving real-time data sync across devices. This showcases my proficiency in cloud technologies and efficient data management.</p>
